# This folder contains several scripts that were used in the MetaBAT2 paper.


## Requirements:

To replicate the results we showed in the paper, you'll need the following:

  1. BAM files from each sample. If you want to generate BAM files yourself, we recommend the BBMap from the bbtools package.(https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/) 
  2. MetaBAT2, CONCOCT, MaxBin or other software tools installed 

## List of scripts:
  1. runBBMap.sh: The BASH script to run BBMap to create the BAM files
  2. benchmark.R: This runs the benchmarking and profiles performance of tools listed above using CAMI datasets.
  3. binning.R is the script we used to perform the binning on CAMI datasets for our MetaBAT 2 paper.
