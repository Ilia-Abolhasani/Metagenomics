# A Novel Method to Improve Binning of Metagenomic Sequence Fragments by Using Gene Ontology Graphs

## Abstract

Bacteria, as the first and most diverse forms of life on Earth, play a crucial role in various biological processes. Metagenomics, the identification of bacterial genomes from DNA sequences obtained directly from environmental samples, is a key field of study in understanding microbial diversity and functionality. Traditional bio-marker based binning methods have limitations, leading to the exploration of bio-marker free methods. However, existing binning methods still lack high accuracy and completeness, binning only a fraction of genome fragments.

This repository contains the implementation of a novel method for improving and completing the Metagenomics data binning process by incorporating biological networks and gene ontology graphs into the initial binning result. The proposed method utilizes the concept that fragments involved in the same biological processes, cellular compartments, or molecular functions likely belong to the same genome. Extensive testing on various datasets, previously binned using base methods, demonstrated significant improvement in binning accuracy and completeness.
